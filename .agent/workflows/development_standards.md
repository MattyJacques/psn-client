// turbo-all
1. Read the project instructions to ensure compliance with coding standards.

### Standards Checklist
- **RuboCop Compliance**: Ensure no new RuboCop errors are introduced. Adhere strictly to the project's Ruby style guide.
- **Frozen String Literals**: All Ruby files MUST start with `# frozen_string_literal: true`.
- **Test Coverage**: Ensure adequate RSpec test coverage (using `expect(...)` syntax) for any new functionality or bug fixes.
- **Type Signatures**: Update RBS signatures in `sig/` whenever method signatures change or new public methods are added.
- **Documentation**: Update documentation and `CHANGELOG.md` when public APIs are modified.

2. Acknowledge and follow these standards for all subsequent tasks in this session.
